        We want you to understand how and
why Grief Resort, Inc. (“Grief Resort,”
“we” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares
information about you when you use our
sites, mobile apps, widgets, and other
online products and services
(collectively, the “Services”) or when you
otherwise interact with us or receive a
communication from us. This Privacy
Policy applies to all of our Services
including Gift Resort Gifts, which
maintains a separate privacy notice that
incorporates this Privacy Policy by
reference.\n
What We Collect (and How it is Used and
Shared)\n
Information You Provide to Us \n
We collect information you provide to us
directly when you use the Services. This
includes:\n
Account information\n
If you create a Grief Resort account, we
may require you to provide a name,
username and password. Your username
is public, and it doesn’t have to be related
to your real name. You may also provide
other account information, like an email
address, bio, or prole picture. We also
store your user account preferences and
settings.\n
Content you submit\n
We collect the content you submit to the
Services. This includes your posts and
comments including saved drafts, videos
you broadcast via RPAN, your messages
with other users (e.g., private messages,
chats, and modmail), and your reports
and other communications with
moderators and with us. Your content
may include text, links, images, gifs, and
videos.\n
Actions you take\n
We collect information about the actions
you take when using the Services. This
includes your interactions with content,
like voting, saving, hiding, and reporting.
It also includes your interactions with
other users, such as following, friending,
and blocking. We collect your
interactions with communities, like your
subscriptions or moderator status.\n
Transactional information\n
If you purchase products or services
from us (e.g Grief Resort Premium or
Grief Resort Coins), we will collect
certain information from you, including
your name, address, email address, and
information about the product or service
you are purchasing. Grief Resort uses
industry-standard payment processor
services (for example, Stripe) to handle
payment information.\n
Other information\n
You may choose to provide other
information directly to us. For example,
we may collect information when you ll
out a form, participate in Grief Resort sponsored activities or promotions, apply
for a job, request customer support, or
otherwise communicate with us.
Information We Collect Automatically
When you access or use our Services, we
may also automatically collect
information about you. This includes:
Log and usage data\n
We may log information when you access
and use the Services. This may include
your IP address, user-agent string,
browser type, operating system, referral
URLs, device information (e.g., device
IDs), device settings, mobile carrier
name, pages visited, links clicked, the
requested URL, and search terms. Except
for the IP address used to create your
account, Grief Resort will delete any IP
addresses collected after 100 days.
Information collected from cookies and
similar technologies\n
We may receive information from
cookies, which are pieces of data your
browser stores and sends back to us
when making requests, and similar
technologies. We use this information to
improve your experience, understand
user activity, personalize content and
advertisements, and improve the quality
of our Services. For example, we store
and retrieve information about your
preferred language and other settings.
See our Cookie Notice for more
information about how Grief Resort uses
cookies. For more information on how
you can disable cookies, please see Your
Choices below\n
Location information\n
We may receive and process information
about your location. For example, with
your consent, we may collect information
about the specific location of your mobile
device (for example, by using GPS or
Bluetooth). We may also receive location
information from you when you choose
to share such information on our
Services, including by associating your
content with a location, or we may derive
your approximate location from other
information about you, including your IP
address.
Other Information\n
We may also use information from
Apple\'s TrueDepth camera to provide
enhanced functionality in the Grief
Resort app camera if you choose to use it.
Information from the TrueDepth camera
is used in real time — we don\'t store this
information on our servers or share it
with third parties.
Information Collected from Other
Sources\n
We may receive information about you
from other sources, including from other
users and third parties, and combine that
information with the other information
we have about you. For example, we may
receive demographic or interest
information about you from third
parties, including advertisers (such as the
fact that an advertiser is interested in
showing you an ad), and combine it with
our own data using a common account
identier such as a hash of an email
address or a mobile-device ID. You can
control how we use this information to
personalize the Services for you as
described in Your Choices - Controlling
Advertising and Analytics below.\n
Linked services\n
If you authorize or link a third-party
service (e.g., an unocial mobile app
client) to access your Grief Resort
account, Grief Resort receives
information about your use of that
service when it uses that authorization.
Linking services may also cause the other
service to send us information about
your account with that service. For
example, if you sign in to Grief Resort
with a third-party identity provider, that
provider may share an email address
with us. Information sharing with linked
services is described later in this section.
Information collected from integrations
We also may receive information about
you, including log and usage data and
cookie information, from third-party
sites that integrate our Services,
including our embeds and advertising
technology. For example, when you visit
a site that uses Grief Resort embeds, we
may receive information about the web
page you visited. Similarly, if an
advertiser incorporates Grief Resort\'s ad
technology, Grief Resort may receive
limited information about your activity
on the advertiser’s site or app, such as
whether you bought something from the
advertiser. You can control how we use
this information to personalize the
Services for you as described in Your
Choices - Controlling Advertising and
Analytics below\n
Information Collected by Third Parties\n
Embedded content\n
Grief Resort displays some linked content
in-line on the Grief Resort services via
“embeds.” For example, Grief Resort
posts that link to YouTube or Twitter may
load the linked video or tweet within
Grief Resort directly from those services
to your device so you don’t have to leave
Grief Resort to see it. In general, Grief
Resort does not control how third-party
services collect data when they serve you
their content directly via these embeds.
As a result, embedded content is not
covered by this privacy policy but by the
policies of the service from which the
content is embedded.\n
Audience measurement\n
We partner with audience measurement
companies (including Quantcast and
Nielsen) to learn demographic
information about the population that
uses Grief Resort. To provide this
demographic information, these
companies collect cookie information to
recognize your device.\n
Information Collected from Advertisers
and Potential Advertisers
If you use Grief Resort Ads (Grief Resort’s
self-serve ads platform at
ads.griefresort.com) we collect some
additional information. To sign up for
Grief Resort Ads, you must provide your
name, email address, and information
about your company. If you purchase
advertising services, you will need to
provide transactional information as
described above, and we may also
require additional documentation to
verify your identity. When using Grief
Resort Ads, we may record a session
replay of your visit for customer service,
troubleshooting, and usability research
purposes.\n
We use information about you to:
Provide, maintain, and improve the
Services;\n
Research and develop new services;\n
Help protect the safety of Grief Resort
and our users, which includes blocking
suspected spammers, addressing abuse,
and enforcing the Grief Resort User
Agreement and our other policies;
Send you technical notices, updates,
security alerts, invoices, and other
support and administrative messages;
Provide customer service;\n
Communicate with you about products,
services, offers, promotions, and events,
and provide other news and information
we think will be of interest to you (for
information about how to opt out of
these communications, see Your
Choices below);\n
Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and
activities in connection with our
Services;\n
Measure the effectiveness of ads shown
on our Services; and
Personalize the Services, and provide
and optimize advertisements, content,
and features that match user proles or
interests.\n
Much of the information on the Services
is public and accessible to everyone, even
without an account. By using the
Services, you are directing us to share
this information publicly and freely.
When you submit content (including a
post, comment, chat message, or RPAN
broadcast) to a public part of the
Services, any visitors to and users of our
Services will be able to see that content,
the username associated with the
content, and the date and time you
originally submitted the content. Grief
Resort allows other sites to embed public
Grief Resort content via our embed tools.
Grief Resort also allows third parties to
access public Grief Resort content via the
Grief Resort API and other similar
technologies. Although some parts of the
Services may be private or quarantined,
they may become public (e.g., at the
moderator’s option in the case of private
communities) and you should take that
into consideration before posting to the
Services.\n
Your Grif Resort account has a prole
page that is public. Your prole contains
information about your activities on the
Services, such as your username, prior
posts and comments, karma, awards
received, trophies, moderator status,
Grief Resort Premium status, and how
long you have been a member of the
Services.\n
We offer social sharing features that let
you share content or actions you take on
our Services with other media. Your use
of these features enables the sharing of
certain information with your friends or
the public, depending on the settings you
establish with the third party that
provides the social sharing feature. For
more information about the purpose and
scope of data collection and processing in
connection with social sharing features,
please visit the privacy policies of the
third parties that provide these social
sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook,
and Twitter).\n
We do not sell your personal
information.\n
However, in addition to the personal
information that is displayed publicly as
described above, we may share personal
information in the following ways:
With your consent. We may share
information about you with your consent
or at your direction.\n
With linked services. If you link your
Grief Resort account with a third-party
service, Grief Resort will share the
information you authorize with that
third-party service. You can control this
sharing as described in Your
Choices below.\n
With our service providers. We may
share information with vendors,
consultants, and other service providers
who need access to such information to
carry out work for us. Their use of
personal data will be subject to
appropriate confidentiality and security
measures. A few examples: (i) payment
processors who process transactions on
our behalf, (ii) cloud providers who host
our data and our services, (iii) third party ads measurement providers who
help us and advertisers measure the
performance of ads shown on our
Services.\n
To comply with the law. We may share
information in response to a request for
information if we believe disclosure is in
accordance with, or required by, any
applicable law, regulation, legal process,
or governmental request, including, but
not limited to, meeting national security
or law enforcement requirements. To the
extent the law allows it, we will attempt
to provide you with prior notice before
disclosing your information in response
to such a request. Our Transparency
Report has additional information about
how we respond to government requests.
In an emergency. We may share
information if we believe it\'s necessary
to prevent imminent and serious bodily
harm to a person.\n
To enforce our policies and rights. We
may share information if we believe your
actions are inconsistent with our User
Agreement, rules, or other Grief Resort
policies, or to protect the rights, property,
and safety of ourselves and others.
With our aliates. We may share
information between and among
GriefResort, and any of our parents,
aliates, subsidiaries, and other
companies under common control and
ownership.\n
Aggregated or de-identified
information. We may share information
about you that has been aggregated or
anonymized such that it cannot
reasonably be used to identify you. For
example, we may show the total number
of times a post has been reacted to
without identifying who the visitors
were, or we may tell an advertiser how
many people saw their ad.\n
How We Protect Your Information
We take measures to help protect
information about you from loss, theft,
misuse and unauthorized access,
disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
For example, we use HTTPS while
information is being transmitted. We also
enforce technical and administrative
access controls to limit which of our
employees have access to nonpublic
personal information.\n
You can help maintain the security of
your account by conjuring two-factor
authentication.\n
We store the information we collect for
as long as it is necessary for the
purpose(s) for which we originally
collected it. We may retain certain
information for legitimate business
purposes or as required by law.\n
Your Choices\n
You have choices about how to protect
and limit the collection, use, and sharing
of information about you when you use
the Services. Some of these choices are

cookies by default. If you prefer, you can
usually choose to set your browser to

technologies are used on Grief Resort, see

networks. To learn more about these
advertisements or to opt out, please visit
the sites of the Digital Advertising
Alliance and the Network Advertising
Initiative, or if you are a user in the
European Economic Area, Your Online

Do Not Track\n
Most modern web browsers give you the
option to send a Do Not Track signal to
the sites you visit, indicating that you do
not wish to be tracked. However, there is
no accepted standard for how a site
should respond to this signal, and we do
not take any action in response to this
signal. Instead, in addition to publicly
available third-party tools, we offer you
the choices described in this policy to
manage the collection and use of
information about you.\n
Controlling Promotional\n

payment purposes; and © to bear any
additional charges that your App
Provider, bank or other financial service
provider may levy on you as well as any

    You and Grief Resort agree that any
dispute, claim or controversy arising out
of or relating to these Terms or the
breach, termination, enforcement,
interpretation or validity thereof or the
use of the Services, Products or Content
(collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by
binding arbitration, except that each
party retains the right: (i) to bring an
individual action in small claims court
and (ii) to seek injunctive or other
equitable relief in a court of competent
jurisdiction to prevent the actual or
threatened infringement,
misappropriation or violation of a party’s
copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
patents or other intellectual property
rights (the action described in the
foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection
Action”). Without limiting the preceding
sentence, you will also have the right to
litigate any other Dispute if you provide
Grief Resort with written notice of your
desire to do so by email at
support@griefresort.com within thirty
(30) days following the date you rst
agree to these Terms (such notice, an
“Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you don’t
provide Grief Resort with an Arbitration
Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day
period, you will be deemed to have
knowingly and intentionally waived your
right to litigate any Dispute except as
expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii)
above. The exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of any IP Protection Action or, if
you timely provide Grief Resort with an
Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the
state and federal courts located in the
Northern District of California and each
of the parties hereto waives any
objection to jurisdiction and venue in
such courts. Unless you timely provide
Grief Resort with an Arbitration Opt-out
Notice, you acknowledge and agree that
you and Grief Resort are each waiving
the right to a trial by jury or to
participate as a plaintiff or class member
in any purported class action or
representative proceeding. Further,
unless both you and Grief Resort
otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator
may not consolidate more than one
person’s claims, and may not otherwise
preside over any form of any class or
representative proceeding. If this specic
paragraph is held unenforceable, then
the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution”
section will be deemed void. Except as
provided in the preceding sentence, this
“Dispute Resolution” section will survive
any termination of these Terms.\n\n

    Arbitration Rules     \n\n

The arbitration will be administered by
the American Arbitration Association
(“AAA”) in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then
in effect, except as modied by this
“Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA
Rules are available
at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling
the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal
Arbitration Act will govern the
interpretation and enforcement of this
Section.\n\n

    Arbitration Process     \n\n

    A party who desires to initiate
arbitration must provide the other party
with a written Demand for Arbitration as
specied in the AAA Rules. (The AAA
provides a general Demand for
Arbitration form and a separate form for
Demand for Arbitration for California
residents.) The arbitrator will be either a
retired judge or an attorney licensed to
practice law and will be selected by the
parties from the AAA’s roster of
arbitrators. If the parties are unable to
agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7)
days of delivery of the Demand for
Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint
the arbitrator in accordance with the
AAA Rules.\n\n

   Arbitration Location and Procedure     \n\n

Unless you and Grief Resort otherwise
agree, the arbitration will be conducted
in the county where you reside. If your
claim does not exceed $10,000, then the
arbitration will be conducted solely on
the basis of the documents that you and
Grief Resort submit to the arbitrator,
unless you request a hearing or the
arbitrator determines that a hearing is
necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000,
your right to a hearing will be
determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to
the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have
the discretion to direct a reasonable
exchange of information by the parties,
consistent with the expedited nature of
the arbitration.\n\n

   Arbitrator’s Decision     \n\n


    The arbitrator will render an award
within the time frame specied in the
AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will
include the essential ndings and
conclusions upon which the arbitrator
based the award. Judgment on the
arbitration award may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof. The
arbitrator’s award of damages must be
consistent with the terms of the
“Limitation of Liability” section above as
to the types and amounts of damages for
which a party may be held liable. The
arbitrator may award declaratory or
injunctive relief only in favor of the
claimant and only to the extent
necessary to provide relief warranted by
the claimant’s individual claim. If you
prevail in arbitration you will be entitled
to an award of attorneys’ fees and
expenses, to the extent provided under
applicable law. Grief Resort will not seek,
and hereby waives all rights it may have
under applicable law to recover,
attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails
in arbitration.
\n\n


   Fees    \n\n

Your responsibility to pay any AAA ling,
administrative and arbitrator fees will be
solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
However, if your claim for damages does
not exceed $75,000, Grief Resort will pay
all such fees unless the arbitrator nds
that either the substance of your claim or
the relief sought in your Demand for
Arbitration was frivolous or was brought
for an improper purpose (as measured
by the standards set forth in Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\n\n


   Changes     \n\n


Notwithstanding the provisions of the
“Modication” section above, if Grief
Resort changes this “Dispute Resolution”
section after the date you rst accepted
these Terms (or accepted any subsequent
changes to these Terms), you may reject
any such change by sending us written
notice (including by email to
support@griefresort.com) within 30 days
of the date such change became effective,
as indicated in the “Last Updated” date
above or in the date of Gift Resort’s email
to you notifying you of such change. By
rejecting any change, you are agreeing
that you will arbitrate any Dispute
between you and Gift Resort in
accordance with the provisions of this
“Dispute Resolution” section as of the
date you rst accepted these Terms (or
accepted any subsequent changes to
these Terms).\n\n

   General Terms     \n\n

These Terms constitute the entire and
exclusive understanding and agreement
between Gift Resort and you regarding
the Services, Products and Content, and
these Terms supersede and replace any
and all prior oral or written
understandings or agreements between
Gift Resort and you regarding the
Services, Products and Content. If any
provision of these Terms is held invalid
or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator
appointed pursuant to the terms of the
“Arbitration” section above or by court of
competent jurisdiction, but only if you
timely opt out of arbitration by sending
us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in
accordance with the terms set forth
above), that provision will be enforced to
the maximum extent permissible and the
other provisions of these Terms will
remain in full force and effect.
You may not assign or transfer these
Terms, by operation of law or otherwise,
without Gift Resort’s prior written
consent. Any attempt by you to assign or
transfer these Terms, without such
consent, will be null and of no effect. Gift
Resort may freely assign or transfer these
Terms without restriction. Subject to the
foregoing, these Terms will bind and
inure to the benet of the parties, their
successors and permitted assigns.
Any notices or other communications
provided by Gift Resort under these
Terms, including those regarding
modications to these Terms, will be
given: (i) by Gift Resort via email; or (ii)
by posting to the Services. For notices
made by e-mail, the date of receipt will
be deemed the date on which such notice
is transmitted.
Gift Resort’s failure to enforce any right
or provision of these Terms will not be
considered a waiver of such right or
provision. The waiver of any such right
or provision will be effective only if in
writing and signed by a duly authorized
representative of Gift Resort. Except as
expressly set forth in these Terms, the
exercise by either party of any of its
remedies under these Terms will be
without prejudice to its other remedies
under these Terms or otherwise.\n\n

5.How a free trial via Apple works
When downloading the Grief Resort app
onto an iOS device, such as an iPhone or
iPad, users have the option to activate a
7-day free trial to Gift Resort Premium
subscription content. This free trial is
through iTunes, which means Apple
handles the activation, cancellation, and
any fees. Please see below for more
explanation about how the free trial
works.\n
1. Create an account:\n Before seeing the
free trial screen, users will rst have an
option to create a Grief Resort account.

locate your information in our system
should you need any assistance.\n

signing in, you will see a screen inviting
you to try 7 days of subscription access.
This unlocks a 7-day trial to a Grief
Resort subscription on your Grief Resort

content. Subscription content will have
lock icons next to it. Tapping on a
subscription option will bring up a
screen to unlock our full library of Grief
Resort Premium subscription content.\n
4. View Subscription Terms:\n If you decide
to start a free trial, click on "Try 7 Days
for Free". You will then see a screen with
an explanation of the trial terms. The
free trial will be active for 7 days, at
which point you will be charged the full
yearly subscription price. Please cancel
the trial at least 24 hours before it ends
to avoid any charges from iTunes.\n

Continue, you will see a nal screen
asking you to conrm your purchase,

you do not wish to continue into a yearly
subscription.\n

been successful if you see everything
unlocked in the app. If you still see lock
icons next to some of the content after
starting the free trial, you can send us a
message for more help.\n
7. Cancel your free trial:\n If you do not
wish to continue into an annual
subscription at the end of the free trial,
please be sure to cancel as soon as
possible.\n
8. Using Grief Resort after your trial: \n
If you cancel the free trial before it ends,
the app will revert back to the locked
version at the end of 7 days. You will then
only be able to access our free content,
which you're welcome to . If you do not
cancel, you will be billed the full annual
subscription price and you will continue
to have access to the full library of Grief
Resort Premium content for the duration
of your 1-year subscription.\n

and most major credit and debit cards
through our website.\n
